          <p class="description">
            At the beginning, when people started doing code, procedural
            programming was the way to go: one instruction was written after the
            other. When applications started gaining complexity, and operations
            became repetitive, programmers started to implement functions that
            they could reuse and where they could group a set of instructions to
            be executed that were related to a functionality or a task.

            As a beginner in Angular and not a regular user of the framework
            sometimes I need a refresher of the main concepts. I decided to put

          <p class="description">
            Mindfulness makes you a better programmer (and human) by training
            your brain to pay attention and engage in the task at hand. With
            practice, mindfulness will increase your productivity by bringing
            awareness to your inner and outer distractions. When you practice
            mindfulness, you are also cultivating compassion for yourself and
            others. This helps you to be less reactive and relate to stress in a
            healthy way.

          <p class="description">
            Creating notes is an exercise in putting thoughts into words, and
            everyone thinks differently, so note-taking demands flexibility.
            Obsidian is the most flexible note-taking app out there. In
            software, flexibility usually means a tool can bend to your desires,
            but it also means you might have to spend significant time
            customizing it. If you need a note-taking system to work exactly the
            way you want and don't mind taking the time to get it there,
            Obsidian is the application you should check out first.

        Hi! I'm Gabriela. My friends call me Gabs or Gaby. I started The
        Unapologetic Blog as an opportunity to share the things that I learned
        over time that I find interesting (I like to take notes of everything
        📝) and I would like to share with others. The knowledge becomes more
        significant when you share it. The main topic discussed here is
        technology, but I would also like to write about other areas of my life
        as I discover them along the way. I hope you enjoy going with me in this
        journey🙂.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's unapologetic because I want to feel I can write about anything
        without having to apologize because it's not too technical, because it's
        not in the original scope, because the posts are too long or too short
        🫠. Just to write accurate free content it's enough for the moment 🧐.
      </p>

        I'm a Colombian Chemical Engineer 🧪 living in Montreal 🍁, who decided
        (as many nowadays) to try programming 🐱‍💻, which is what I have been
        doing since 2020. Currently I'm pursuing an AEC in Programming and
        Internet Technologies at Institut Superieur d'informatique - ISI, so a
        great part of this blog it's composed by my class notes. I'm also a
        researcher and science teacher 👩‍🔬. In my free time, I am a meditation
        instructor 🧘‍♀️and I play ukulele 🎵.

        That is reason why I chose the rainbow 🌈 as the logo for this project.
        Besides I love rainbows and color, I find I can be as diversified in the
        number of things I like to learn, as the colors of the rainbow. And I
        think that is the way all human beings are💃. It's hard (and boring) to
        frame people in only one area of their lives.
