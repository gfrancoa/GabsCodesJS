      <p class="title">OOP 101 Part I - Why OOP?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          At the beginning, when people started doing code, procedural
          programming was the way to go: one instruction was written after the
          other. When applications started gaining complexity, and operations
          became repetitive, programmers started to implement functions that
          they could reuse and where they could group a set of instructions to
          be executed that were related to a functionality or a task.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this was not enough. Now the code looked like a never-ending
          list of random functions. And even though the functionalities could be
          grouped by files, there was a better way to organize it.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Remember programming it's all about modeling the real world and give
          instructions so detailed that the machine is able to automatize tasks
          we were doing by ourselves before. Computers, in its original state,
          are able to compute massive amount of data (faster than a human) but
          you have to tell them how to do it. They are not able to make
          decisions or to analyze data by themselves, with the exception of the
          Artificial Intelligence applications so widely used nowadays, but even
          those programs had to be taught at the beginning of how to behave and
          which constraints to include.

            Object Oriented Programming (OOP) was designed as a way to model a
            system, to make it closer to the real life, grouping both data and
            behavior in a single entity called class. By data we mean variables
            and by behavior we mean methods. Just to clarify: The functions
            inside a class we call them methods and the variables commonly
            receive the name of members (for the latter exists more names but we
            will use this one).

          <p>
            Think of a class as a template. We can reuse this template as many
            times as we want. The entities that we create using this template we
            call them objects, so objects are materializations of a class. In
            programming we say: an object is an instance of a class.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Class members</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            But take into account that every object can be slightly different
            (or not) from the other because its members could have different
            values. For example, I can have the class student, which has as
            members name, address and date of birth but every object is going to
            instantiate this class in a different way since the values for the
            variables can be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if two objects have the exact same value? Are they the same
            object? Well, I can print the same book two times but even though
            they have the same content they are two books, two objects. Every
            created object normally is located in a different address in memory
            (take into account this may vary between programming languages and
            the way they do the memory management).
