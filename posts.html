            <p class="description">
              At the beginning, when people started doing code, procedural
              programming was the way to go: one instruction was written after
              the other. When applications started gaining complexity, and
              operations became repetitive, programmers started to implement
              functions that they could reuse and where they could group a set
              of instructions to be executed that were related to a
              functionality or a task.

            <p class="description">
              Mindfulness makes you a better programmer (and human) by training
              your brain to pay attention and engage in the task at hand. With
              practice, mindfulness will increase your productivity by bringing
              awareness to your inner and outer distractions. When you practice
              mindfulness, you are also cultivating compassion for yourself and
              others. This helps you to be less reactive and relate to stress in
              a healthy way.

            <p class="description">
              Creating notes is an exercise in putting thoughts into words, and
              everyone thinks differently, so note-taking demands flexibility.
              Obsidian is the most flexible note-taking app out there. In
              software, flexibility usually means a tool can bend to your
              desires, but it also means you might have to spend significant
              time customizing it. If you need a note-taking system to work
              exactly the way you want and don't mind taking the time to get it
              there, Obsidian is the application you should check out first.

            </p>
            <p class="description">
              OOP has three main pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance and
              Polymorphism. Encapsulation It's all about combining data
              (variables) and behavior (methods) in one single class altogether.
              The objects are conceived like containers or capsules. But more
              than that, these data and behavior access can be modified to
              restrict access to read or write information from the object, so
              in OOP we have the following access modifiers that can be applied
              to both members and methods.

            <p class="description">
              Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks
              are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as
              dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using
              pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a
              perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy
              steps.

              A good programmer is not only concerned with WRITING CODES, but he
              has to look upon several other facets as well like the code should
              be clean, optimized, easily maintainable, etc. It certainly
              requires a lot of focus and concentration from the programmer. And
              above all that, when he is expected to show better productivity
              and efficiency traits – things become more challenging, isn’t it??

              As an implementation engineer, you will be responsible and

              network, hardware, and software solutions of a company. You will
              participate in all phases of design, testing, and implementing
              processes and help to modify the project scope and troubleshoot
              problems with efficiency. You may need to perform data analysis

              Code is written once. Then it's read, debugged, refactored, and
              scaled constantly. How you write code today will help you maintain
              and scale the application later down the road. We're frequently
              under the pressure of deadlines in software development.
              Regardless, it's important to use coding best practices to help
              ensure better quality code for yourself and for anyone who may
              have to extend that code in the future.
